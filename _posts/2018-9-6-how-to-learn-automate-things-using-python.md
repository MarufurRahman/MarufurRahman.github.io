title: How can I learn to automate things using Python? 
---

If you look back every project , every program written is an automation of human task at some level. 
Most of the programmers donâ€™t think this way. so they are facing challenges solving problems.

To automate things, you need not start with Python, Python is your end language to deploy your automation solution. 
i will define a 5 step approach to solve any critical problem with a proper solution.

## First step,
is to think on how that thing or task is being done now without using python (or any other technology), in case if it is a new task, you need to think of how you would do it without using technology.

## Second step, 
List out the steps involved how the task is being done/could be done and also people involved in the process

## Third step, 
if the task is big or if multiple people are involved divide the whole task into small parts may be basing on person doing the task or timing or department etc.

## Fourth step,
 is to solve each of these individual parts using an algorithm (design), this will also specify for automation, if we have dependency like sending an email , sms , reading data from device etc.

## Fifth step,
 is to convert each of the above algorithms into code in any language, here if you like to use python , you need to explore on what on python can do things as mentioned in above algorithm or design of each part and you may need to use external libraries as per dependencies like mail, message, scraping, database, api, network, etc.

All the best !!!
